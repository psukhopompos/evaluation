                        <p>This New Brighton home offers nearly 2,400 square feet of finished space, thoughtfully arranged into two distinct living zones. This functional design provides exceptional flexibility for both daily family life and entertaining.</p>
                        <p>The main level showcases the home's quality construction through its vaulted ceilings and hardwood floors. The fireplace creates a natural gathering point in the living room, while the kitchen's layout encourages conversation between cooking and dining areas. Three bedrooms and three full bathrooms eliminate morning bottlenecks and accommodate guests comfortably.</p>
                        <p>The fully finished basement with egress windows represents a significant asset. This isn't just storage space – it's a legitimate lower level that functions as a family room, play area, or home office. The walk-up attic adds another dimension of storage rarely found in homes of this era.</p>
                        <p>Outside, the 0.37-acre lot provides genuine privacy without overwhelming maintenance. The deck connects indoor and outdoor living naturally. Perhaps most compelling: zero association fees mean you control your property decisions and save thousands annually.</p>
                        <p>At $439,900, this property delivers exceptional square footage and functionality in a market where finished basements and three full baths command premium prices.</p>

                        <p>A family home needs more than just bedrooms; it needs distinct living zones where everyone can find their own space. This property on Robin Lane is designed around that principle, offering a level of function and volume that is immediately apparent.</p>
                        <p>On the main level, vaulted ceilings create an open atmosphere, especially in the 15x12 living room, which is anchored by a central fireplace. You'll find durable hardwood floors and classic paneled doors, details that speak to the home's solid 1986 construction. The exterior combines brick and vinyl, providing a low-maintenance and lasting finish. From the main living area, you have easy access to a deck, which steps down to a patio and a yard with medium tree coverage.</p>
                        <p>The fully finished basement is where this home truly expands. With proper egress windows, it's a legitimate and safe lower level, not just a converted storage area. This space functions as a second family room, a dedicated play zone, or a media room, effectively doubling your usable living area.</p>
                        <p>For storage, a walk-up attic provides a practical and accessible solution that many homes lack. It's a significant bonus for keeping seasonal items organized and out of the way. A two-car garage handles vehicles and tools. Critically, there is no association fee. This provides a tangible financial saving every month and gives you more control over your property. It's a complete package offering space, function, and long-term value.</p>
